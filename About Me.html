		<HR>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hello! My name is Erikson Myles Jardim, author and creator of the many books that you will find on this website and scattered throughout 
		Fimfiction. I live as most of you probably know in Canada, Ontario and I have lived here for all of my life. I will say however, that I do visit my family
		oversees in Finland, I always find myself looking forwards to each trip as it's an experience that is always different. This being said I'm a very adventurous
		person, most time I find myself completely lost.
		<br><br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I started writing on Fimfiction on May,1st,2014. As some of you may know that is the exact date that 'Falling For a Star' came out.
		What drove me to write a story was that I simply ran out of fics that I 'truly' loved. I know that there are millions of amazing books on that site and 
		hundreds more arrive everyday, however I was not satisfied (call me selfish I know). So I opened up my word document and started my very own story on
		which I and the community could alter at there own will.
		<br><br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now to say that the book did well when it first came out is a misinterpretation that I find most people make. My book 'Falling For a Star'
		actually started off negative and then worked its way up to 50-50 and finally to what it is now over 4 times more likes. This just proves my point that if you
		start a story, keep working on it and editing it you'll succeed. Now that I think about it people have been telling me that all the time "aim for the stars
		and you'll get there.".
		<br><br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Anyway...</i> I myself do not and will not ever ask people that read my stories for money. This is a hobby of mine just like coding is and
		it's something that I would feel guilty if I were to ask for money. Mostly because everyone on Fimfiction already gives away their books for free. It was them that
		inspired me to make my own novel, a feeling I hope to pass onto you.
		<br><br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People say that I have a very happy and positive attitude, do I believe any of their talk; no not really. While I do keep a positive vibe around
		other people I find myself very stressed out while I'm alone. This was another reason I started writing, it let me express myself non-directly. This open vent
		vastly improved my positive aurora that a lot of people commented on. I started to make many more friends, not to mention the amount of more parties I went to.
		<br><br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I find most people asking me about is if I watch the show. My simple answerer to that is not any more, I used to watch the show back when
		I was starting 'Falling For a Star'. After the fourth season I stopped watching any and all episodes. I have not watched any of the movies either, as you will see 
		my writing will tend to not include any of the later episodes or movies.
		<br><br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For you that really want to know, my favourite pone is Spitfire, Luna coming close but not quite reaching top tier. Out of the mane six I find
		Rainbow Dash to be most like me, bash, loyal, egotistic (sadly) and the undeniable need for speed.
		<br><br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As of right now I'm working for a courir company and that is how I am able to pay the bills and live. This however is a temporary job as I
		am attending a collage for aviation. After that I will be moving on to become a pilot, flying oil and supplies up north. That really is all I have to say about
		my life.
		<br><br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you ever wish to contact me, you can skype me at Erikson1231 or email me at fim.ccpone@gmail.com.
